# Chapter 1: The Bedroom

He closed with a thud the heavy trunk, weighted with many delicately-woven dress shirts, whose intricate patterns were preserved through careful folding in just the right places. The corrosion-speckled clasps snapped shut, with their mechanism sound, even after many years of use. A satisfied sigh escaped his lips, such was the result of quality workmanship.

He couldn't remember the price he had paid for the now-aging trunk, but he could picture the bazaar in far-off Cairo where he bought it, with the sun-bleached white linen stretched over plain wooden market stalls and the smell of herbs, dried hibiscus flowers, and spice in the dry air...

A thought narrowed his eyes: What currency had he bought the trunks with? `The Pound`? `The Piastre`? He found it difficult to keep track of these things. He would look it up later: he knew exactly which of his many notebooks it would be in.

His eyes glanced over at the large dark oak bookcase next to his newly-stripped four-poster bed. Until last week this floor-to-ceiling unit stored his collection of notebooks. He was an habitual graphomaniac; every evening, without fail, would find him sat at his desk journaling his thoughts and experiences. Either here in the bedroom or in his study, or perhaps the library, his mood decided where it would be best to write.

He shook himself slightly and stretched, looking about him. The bedroom was grand, his requirements for the room had been very clear: Soft silk drapes in bright colours hanging from nearly every surface, the walls, wrapped around the posts of the bed  and up to the ceiling

<span class="sidenote">a style he first discovered in his formative years traveling in the Orient</span>
Paintings he had commissioned from the great artists of the time, of simple scenes, landscapes, rivers, and sunsets. `He found they` calmed his nerves and put him in a tranquil mind.

He rose and stepped over to the silver basin in the corner, plunging his hands into the fresh water, drawn daily by one of his staff from a source north of the city. He was quite particular about his water, the stuff that came out of the tap was most distasteful and made him quite unwell. Years before, after the house was bought, he had struck out into the countryside in search of just the right quality that would satisfy. After many weeks, a small stream was found winding through a valley that overjoyed him. The waters were cool, clear and with a remarkable, crisp taste. He smiled at the recollection, what luck! After arrangements were made with the farmer to purchase all the valley, up to and including the spring of the river, he returned to the city and bathed in no other water again.

He splashed water from the silver basin onto his face. The water was not as cool as it should have been, he wondered if the `valet` had stored yesterday's water, rather than making the trip today. He made a note to ask the `butler`.

The butler would be used for houshold tasks, whereas the valet was more of a personal assistant: hanging out tomorrow's clothes, etc.

His hand grasped air where the towel should have been, hanging underneath the delicate frame of the basin. It had been packed. A quick drawing of air through his teeth belied his annoyance of the interruption of convenience.
He pulled open the heavy wardrobe doors in search of something to dry his hands. Inside was mostly bare. The silken suits, ornate flowing dress robes, and evening attire that comprised most of his winter `clothes` were now all carefully stored and winding their way out of the capital on their way to the southerly port of Southampton, for their onward journey to the New World. There were a few scraps of accoutrements left here, a silk glove that could not be matched with its twin, a delicate black cashmere scarf with ruby-coloured pressed roses skillfully inlaid into the ends, and a black, bent, top hat. He dried his hands on the scarf and dropped it on the floor next to the basin.

`MARK THIS TRANSITION`

A sound from outside his shutters drew him to the window. Below his second-story window people were bustling around. It was just before midday, his normal breakfast time, and black-suited businessmen were going to and from their offices. His house was on St James Square, between the London Library and the East India Club. He would often spend hours on the balcony overlooking the square watching tradesmen and townfolk come and go, a pipe in one hand and a mug of coffee at his elbow.

He stepped back from the window to sit on the bed, now sadly bereft of its exotic fabric wrappings. The bedclothes had been mostly packed, so his valet had left him with barely anything to sleep with. He had just a single feather pillow and heavy sheet. His sleep was not as bad as he was worried it might, without his accustomed mountain of pillows of various sizes and layers of soft bedding.

His heart ached seeing his once-opulent retreat stripped of its fine furnishings. It had become a microcosm his life. Everything contained just right: his little desk, the books on his nightstand, his reading chair by the window, and his bed - the nest he could retreat to at the end of the evening.

He recalled the first morning he woke up in this house as though he was seeing it again:  The crisp sun gently flowing through the half-opened shutters <label for="sn-demo" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label> <input type="checkbox" id="sn-demo" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">he had instructed his valet to open at nine a.m.</span> Everything had been put in place and prepared with precise instructions before his arrival. The sun reflecting on the water basin made delicate ripples on the ceiling, just as he had hoped! There was a slight trace of steam coming in under the en-suite bathroom door. Yes! The bath had been drawn just as he instructed.

Had his bathsalts been packed? He was drawn back to the present by this thought.
Standing again, he walked to the bathroom door, his delicate calfskin leather slippers causing a soft scrunching sound on the thick carpet. The double doors opened inward to reveal a luxurious bathroom.
Its marble-floored room was almost as large as his bedroom, with two basins at the far end either side of a stone `dressing table`. His eye was drawn to the large copper, circular bath in the centre of the room. Fed by hot spring water from the pump room in the basement, a marvel of Victorian innovation. He ran his hands over the tap mechanism, tracing the lettering of the manufacturers and the date, `1834`. The bath was of extravagant size. Quite big enough for two or <label for="sn-demo" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label> <input type="checkbox" id="sn-demo" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">as he recalled with a wry smile</span> three.

He stepped to the dresser, opening the light-paneled bottom drawer and examined its contents. Indeed, his salts had been forgotten! He brought the box up onto the desk, so as to be noticed by the `butler` upon a subsequent inspection. He rifled through the odd-shaped bottles, each containing different coloured grains. Some were simple flecks of white, others shards of an onyx sand. Yet more had crumbled spices in, here a stick of cinnamon, there corns of dried black pepper. `DESCRIBE THE BOX, WITH SILVER-TOPPED PHIALS` He had a concoction for every mood. Some mixes were to invigorate if, after an evening of entertaining, he needed a little pep in the morning. Many were for the opposite, tinctures of cammomile or jasmine, blended to unwind the mind and relax the humours.

He patted the box after closing the lid. The sense of smell, he thought, goes quite wanting in this modern age. He had considered himself very learned on the subject. He always had an affinity - a delicate nose - for subtle fragrances. A lady's perfume, once noted, was as indelibly etched into his memory as her face. Oft would he be informed of the subtleties of his acquaintances' lives by this sense - Lady `Fanshaw` is no longer wearing the perfume her husband likes? Well isn't that interesting. A faint hint of Opium on Lord `Smith`'s hankerchief? Goodness me I thought he had given it up! And so on.
It is a world quite removed from the visual/auditory world that his tiresome peers seem to inhabit.
He recalled a lecture at the Club he attended one hot summer's evening. The presenter, Professor something-or-other, had shown illuminated daguerreotypes coupled with playing of wax cylinders of the sounds that accompanied the images.
How distasteful, to raise but two senses above the others, and to eliminate the experience in total! He left rather early that evening, he recalled.

The marble floor, which had until this week been heated with an ingenious system of pipes <label for="sn-demo" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label> <input type="checkbox" id="sn-demo" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">in the Roman style</span> underneath, was now very cold. He suppressed a shiver, feeling renewed in his ennui due to the dichotomy of his senses and his memory of this room. His hand automatically reached for the close-at-hand tap, which issued forth hot water to warm his curling hands.

Stepping back into his bedroom, his eyes were drawn to the reddening of the `facades` Square's white-fronted houses. Evening was no doubt closing in, a fact confirmed with a glance at the silver pocket watch he had withdrawn from a waistcoat pocket. The intricate gothic hands pointed to 7 and 50. it would be time for a little supper soon, he thought. Turning over the watch in his hand, he ran his thumb over the etched symbol on the back, a left-facing crescent moon inside a hexagon with some detailing around the edge - his house heraldry. He swept it with his thumb again, as was his habit, before replacing it in fob pocket of his velvet waistcoat.

With a hand on his bedroom door, he cast his eyes around for the last time on his old digs.
He took in the empty bookshelf, slightly faded on the side that faced the window, the silver basin, the detailed paneling on the walls, now exposed by lack of coverings. He took it all in, savoring it, to be immortalised in that evening's journal. With a quick movement, he opened the door and stepped into the corridor.
